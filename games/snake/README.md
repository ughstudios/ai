# Snake-And-Apple

This folder contains a Python-based interactive Snake game.

## Running the game
```bash
python main.py
```

The original project included images for screenshots and an animated
preview. These were removed to keep the repository lightweight.

## Controls
1. The game begins with a snake of length 3 waiting for user input
2. Keyboard Up, Down, Right, and Left are used to navigate
3. The result of the game is displayed at the end of the game
4. Click anywhere on the result screen to play again
